How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It was easier to go through only the lines with the differences than going through the whole code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

It would be pretty easy for me to go back to the version which I am more confident with and start over again.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

It gives you the control to choose which snapshot would you like to return to.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

I think a lot of your code are inter-dependent and should be a part of a single commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log will help you get the different git commit ids. git diff will help you compare 2 different versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

You always have your previous code and you feel more confident about making changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I would use it for safety net as I would explore more features in my code
